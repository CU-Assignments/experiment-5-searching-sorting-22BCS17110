## üìÇ Problem Statements & Solutions  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**  
- **Problem:** Given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) that has been rotated at an unknown pivot, find the index of a given `target`. 
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`  
- **Solution:** Implemented using binary search.  
- **Code File:** `search_rotated_array.cpp`  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge Overlapping Intervals**  
- **Problem:** Given an array of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals and return a set of non-overlapping intervals.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` (due to sorting)  
- **Solution:** Sorting and iterating over intervals to merge overlapping ones.  
- **Code File:** `merge_intervals.cpp`  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Search in a Sorted Matrix**  
- **Problem:** Given an `m x n` matrix where rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, search for a given `target` value.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m + n)`  
- **Solution:** Binary search starting from the top-right corner.  
- **Code File:** `search_matrix.cpp`  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Find Peak Element**  
- **Problem:** Find a peak element in an array where a peak is greater than its neighbors.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`  
- **Solution:** Binary search to efficiently locate a peak element.  
- **Code File:** `find_peak_element.cpp`  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Find Kth Largest Element**  
- **Problem:** Find the `k`th largest element in an unsorted array without sorting.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log k)` (using a min heap)  
- **Solution:** Using a min heap to maintain the `k` largest elements.  
- **Code File:** `find_kth_largest.cpp`
